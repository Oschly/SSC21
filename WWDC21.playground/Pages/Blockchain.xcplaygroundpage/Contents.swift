 # Blockchain
 ## Why is it so cool?
 
 Blockchain, like the name suggests, is a chain of blocks. In the beginning, it was meant to secure documents and other files from changing their metadata like creation/last modification date to prevent it from being corrupted by bad people, but its use changed after time.
 
 ## What made it popular today?
 When we are talking with a junior programmers or inexperienced project managers you can often hear "Let's use blockchain!", but why exactly we have these answers now, but we didn't in the 90s if blockchain has been invented much earlier?
  
 ## The answer as always is money.
 Well, not the physical one as many people think, but rather a digital currency that is usually not owned by banks nor countries, and it's called **cryptocurrency**.
 
 First real usage was presented in the first cryptocurrency - Bitcoin (BTC), which is today the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.
 Bitcoin uses blockchain to:
 - Decentralise its whole management.
 - Make it safer, as all owners of this coin also have a copy of BTC's blockchain.
 - Make it more private, as people don't need to provide their data to use it.
 
 
 ## Sounds great, but how does the blockchain work?
