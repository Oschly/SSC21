 # Where can I find real-world usage examples of blockchain?
 ### 1. Cryptocurrency
  
  Most of the cryptocurrencies are using blockchain to make sure that all transactions are valid and their implementations are usually quite different. The most popular differences are in proofing. The two most popular ones are:
  
 - **Proof of Work** - here you, as the prover, prove to verifiers that "a certain amount of computational effort has been expanded for some purpose" (wikipedia.org). So, you have to give your computer's computing power to help in blockchain validations.
  
 - **Proof of Stake** - here the creator of the next block is chosen "via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e., the stake)." (wikipedia.org) - that means if you want to be proven, you have to hold some amount of value (like tokens in cryptocurrencies) and life of something that you own from that technology (like a life of your wallet in cryptocurrencies) must achieve given lifetime.
  
  ### 2. Storage Network
  
  There's a technology called [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), which is a network that persistently stores files and documents. How does it do that? Well, in simple words your files have own hashes (so there cannot be any duplicates in the network) and multiple devices that are interested are storing this file. Also, all of these devices are storing indexes to route users to the "node" which has a copy of a file that they want. Every file can have a readable name (instead of an unreadable UUID), that is managed by a decentralized naming system - IPNS.
  
  ### 3. And many more...
  
  Blockchain has an unlimited amount of usage with the data. Properly implemented can solve multiple issues that we are facing today. If you can search through the web, you can find ideas of using blockchain in IDs, copyright protection, digital voting (do you remember that meme?), and tax regulations. Of course, there are many overuses of this technology, but it's important to know that blockchain can be scalable even to global usage (as in previous points we can see that).
